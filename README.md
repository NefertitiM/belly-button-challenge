# belly-button-challenge 

An interactive dashboard was built to explore microbiomes in the human navel. The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, a catalog of those microbes, was used in this activity.

## Visualizations

A bar chart displaying the top ten bacteria cultures found per indiviual was generated and a bubble chart was created showing the amount of bacteria samples per individual. In addition, demographic information for each individual was created and listed in a chart. A dropdown was also created for each individual where both visualizations and the chart update according to the dropdown.
